# Purpose

* This folder is intended to provide a framework for understanding business intelligence systems as well as the provision of high quality, integrated data for decision support through data warehousing. 
* The documents has a particular focus on the evolutionary process of developing data warehousing using relational database management systems, and multi-dimensional modelling for structuring business intelligence data.

* It amis to explore various aspects of data warehousing, including architecture, design, implementation, and optimisation. Each concept in data warehouse design are taught using various case studies and practical exercises
and proficience skill in SQL knowledge.
